In DecentHolograms, you can configure various flags on holograms and hologram lines. These flags mostly disable some functionality that you don't want or need.

/// info
A flag on a hologram affects all its Lines but different lines can have different flags without affecting each other or the parent hologram.

## List of Flags

These are all flags, that are currently available:

- `DISABLE_UPDATING` - Disables updating for hologram or line.
- `DISABLE_PLACEHOLDERS` - Disables placeholders for hologram or line.
- `DISABLE_ANIMATIONS` - Disables animations for hologram or line.
