## Permissions

DecentHolograms is a plugin specifically designed for server administrators and as such, it simplifies permissions by requiring only one permission node, `dh.admin`, to access all of its features and functionality.

## Commands

With a wide range of commands, effectively utilizing this plugin may require a basic understanding of some general rules. This will be helpful to work with the commands effectively.

### Arguments

Parenthesis only specifiy the type of an argument, they are **not** part of the final command.

| Parenthesis | Meaning                  |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| `<>`        | Required argument.       |
| `[]`        | Optional argument.       |
| `{}`        | List of possible values. |

### Tab Completion

The majority of commands and sub-commands feature tab-completion functionality, which can be used to quickly type commands and determine valid values for arguments.

## Editing Holograms

Here is an example of how to create a new hologram with multiple lines and pages using the available commands.

### Create the hologram

![creating a hologram](../assets/images/setup/hologram-create.png){ loading="lazy" }

### Edit lines

> ```
> /dh line set example 1 1 &3&lDECENT HOLOGRAMS

![editing a hologram](../assets/images/setup/hologram-edit.png){ loading="lazy" }

### Add another page

You can have as many pages as you'd like.

> ```
> /dh page add example
> /dh page switch example 2
> ```

![adding a page to a hologram](../assets/images/setup/hologram-page.png){ loading="lazy" }

### Setup actions

To allow players to navigate between pages, you can simply do this:

> ```
> /dh page addaction example 1 RIGHT NEXT_PAGE
> /dh page addaction example 2 LEFT PREV_PAGE
> ```

By setting up appropriate click actions, players can navigate between the pages by right-clicking the first page to switch to the next page, and left-clicking the second page to switch back to the first page.

#### You can also switch to a specific page { #switch-to-specific-page }

> ```
> /dh page addaction example 2 RIGHT PAGE:1
> ```

We offer a variety of click actions, all of which are explained in detail on [this page](actions.md).
