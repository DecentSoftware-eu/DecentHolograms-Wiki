title: DecentHologramsReloadEvent
description: 'Extends DecentHologramsEvent'
---

This event is called whenever DecentHolograms is being reloaded through its [`/dh reload`](../../general/commands/general.md#dh-reload) command.  
This is useful for when your plugin needs to be aware of any reloads by DecentHolograms (i.e. to refresh own holograms added or other special cases).

## Methods

*No methods outside the standard Event ones by Spigot/Paper*
