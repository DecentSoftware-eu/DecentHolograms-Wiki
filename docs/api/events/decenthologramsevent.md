title: 'DecentHologramsEvent'
---

This is the most basic event offered by DecentHolograms.  
All other events extend from it and it can be used as a catch-all for any DecentHolograms-based events.  
It's recommended to use the more specific events, but if you want to use this one, it is recommended to do `instanceof` checks and casting to more specific Event instances to use possible getters.
