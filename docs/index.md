## What's DecentHolograms?

DecentHolograms is a very versatile hologram plugin that offers a wide range of features and customization options, making it easy to create unique and personalized holograms.

With a user-friendly command interface, you can easily create and customize holograms without the need to edit any configuration files.

- Our holograms are interactive, featuring a variety of clock actions for added functionality.
- Our holograms feature a system for text animations, adding dynamic visual elements to each line.
- Our holograms support line offset, allowing you to position individual lines away from the center of the parent hologram.
- Our holograms feature a permission system, allowing you to restrict access to specific holograms or lines for certain players.
- Our holograms include preset features such as damage and heal displays, providing ready-to-use functionality for your server.
